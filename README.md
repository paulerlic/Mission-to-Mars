# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this project is to scrape the redplanetscience.com website to view the different hemispheres of Mars and return their images. This way we can also store the data in our Mongo database and we can alter the design of the website to be visually appealing. 

The purpose of this project is to help Robin add more polish to her web app. Robin loves Mars she can't get enough of that sweet sweet red planet Elon Musk has been talking about invading *settling. In this project we are going to help Robin by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images. Then we are going to store the scraped data on a Mongo database and use a web app to display those sweet mars facts and hemispheres. Addtionally we are going to go the extra mile and beautify the site with some bootstrap components to make it more presentable.
